# Task
#
# Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), 
# and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    tax = meal_cost * tax_percent/100
    tip = meal_cost * tip_percent/100
    totalCost = round(meal_cost + tax + tip)

    print(totalCost)
